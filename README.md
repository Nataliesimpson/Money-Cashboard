# money-cashboard
First project (week 5 of CodeClan)- using Ruby &amp; SQL database

I created an app to track personal spending so users have a better idea of where their money is going.

- Users can add new tranactions which can edited & deleted. 

- Total spend is shown in a seperate Account section which can be broken down by category. 

- TDD utilised throughout.

- Tools for project planning included Trello & Balsamiq for wireframes.
